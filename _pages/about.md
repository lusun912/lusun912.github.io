I am currently a research scientist at [RIKEN AIP](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/), and a special researcher at [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) (formerly Tokyo Tech), Japan.

I was born in September, 1985, in [Zhengzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou), China. I received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 2009, the M.S. degree in electronic circuits and systems from Northeast Normal University, China, in 2013, and the Dr. Eng. degree in Information Engineering from Hokkaido University (Supervisor: Prof. [Mineichi Kudo](https://researchmap.jp/read0166594)), in 2017. During 2017-2019, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. [Hiroshi Mamitsuka](https://www.bic.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pathway/mami/) at Kyoto University. During 2019-2024, I worked as an assistant professor at ShanghaiTech University. In November 2024, I joined RIKEN AIP as a research scientist in the [AI Security and Privacy Team](https://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/aip/ai_soc/ai_sec_privacy/index.html) .
