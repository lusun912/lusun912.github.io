I am an assistant professor with the School of Information Science and Technology at [ShanghaiTech University](http://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), China.

I was born in September, 1985, in [Zhengzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengzhou), China. I received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Wuhan University, China, in 2009, the M.S. degree in electronic circuits and systems from Northeast Normal University, China, in 2013, and the Dr. Eng. degree in Information Engineering from Hokkaido University (Supervisor: Prof. [Mineichi Kudo](https://prml.main.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/member/mineichi-kudo/)), in 2017. During 2017-2019, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher under the supervision of Prof. [Hiroshi Mamitsuka](https://www.bic.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pathway/mami/) at Kyoto University. In November 2019, I joined the faculty of ShanghaiTech University as a tenure-track assistant professor.
